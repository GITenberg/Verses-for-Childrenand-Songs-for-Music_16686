<h2>PREFACE</h2>


<p>It has been decided in publishing this volume to
reproduce the illustrations with which the verses
originally appeared in <i>Aunt Judy's Magazine</i>. In all
cases Mrs. Ewing wrote the lines to fit the pictures,
and it is worthy of note to observe how closely she has
introduced every detail into her words. Most of the
woodcuts are by German artists, Oscar Pletsch, Fedor
Flinzer, and others; but the frontispiece is from an
original sketch by Mr. Gordon Browne. In accordance
with his special desire, it has only been used for
Mrs. Ewing's poem, as the Convalescent was a little
friend of the artist, who did not live to complete his
recovery. The poem is the last that Mrs. Ewing
wrote for children, and it was penned when she
herself was enduring the discomforts of convalescence
with all the courage she so warmly advocates.</p>

<p>Mr. Randolph Caldecott's illustrations to "Mother's
Birthday Review" first appeared in his <i>Sketch Book</i>,
but the letterpress that accompanied them was very
brief, and Mrs. Ewing could not resist asking permission
to write some verses to the pictures, and
publish them in <i>Aunt Judy's Magazine</i>. This favour
was kindly granted, and by Mrs. Caldecott's further
kindness the sketches are again used here.</p>

<p>The contents of this volume have been arranged
chronologically as far as is possible.</p>

<p>"The Willow Man" and "Grandmother's Spring"
were both written to protest against wantonly wasting
Dame Nature's gifts, and the Note on page 69 shows
that Mrs. Ewing had learnt this lesson herself in childhood.
My Father has lately recalled an incident which
he believes first roused our Mother to teach the lesson
to us. They were driving to Sheffield one day, when
on Bolsover Hill they saw a well-known veterinary
surgeon of the district, Mr. Peech, who had dismounted
from his horse, and was carefully taking up
a few roots of white violets from a bank where they
grew in some profusion. He showed Mrs. Gatty what
he was gathering, but told her he was taking care to
<i>leave a bit behind</i>. This happened fully forty years
ago, long before the Selborne and other Societies for
the preservation of rare plants and birds had come
into existence, and Mother was much impressed and
pleased by Mr. Peech's delicate scrupulousness.</p>

<p>"A Soldier's Children" was written in 1879, whilst
many friends were fighting in South Africa, and ten
years before a story bearing the same name was issued
by the writer of <i>Bootles' Baby</i>.</p>

<p>The "Songs for Music" appeared in 1874 in a
volume called <i>Songs by Four Friends</i>, except the two
last poems, "Anemones" and "Autumn Tints." The
former was given by Mrs. Ewing to her brother, Mr.
Alfred Scott-Gatty, to set to music, and it has
recently been published by Messrs. Boosey. "Autumn
Tints" was found amongst Mrs. Ewing's papers after
her death, and is now printed for the first time.</p>

<h2><a name="MASTER_FRITZ" id="MASTER_FRITZ"></a>MASTER FRITZ</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Fritz and I are not brother and sister, but we're next-door neighbours; for we both live next door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mean we both live next door to each other; for I live at number three, and Fritz and Nickel the dog live at number four.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
<span class="i0">In summer we climb through the garret windows and sit together on the leads,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if the sun is too hot Mother lends us one big kerchief to put over both our heads.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes she gives us tea under the myrtle tree in the big pot that stands in the gutter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(One slice each, and I always give Fritz the one that has the most butter.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In winter we sit on the little stool by the stove at number four;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For when it's cold Fritz doesn't like to go out to come in next door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was one day in spring that he said, "I should like to have a house to myself with you Grethel, and Nickel." And I said, "Thank you, Fritz."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said, "If you'll come in at tea-time and sit by the stove, I'll tell you tales that'll frighten you into fits.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About boys who ran away from their homes, and were taken by robbers, and run after by wolves, and altogether in a dreadful state.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I saw the pictures of it in a book I was looking in, to see where perhaps I should like to emigrate.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've not quite settled whether I shall, or be cast away on a desert island, or settle down nearer home;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
<span class="i0">But you'd better come in and hear about it, and then, wherever it is, you'll be sure to be ready to come."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I took my darling Katerina in my arms, and we went in to tea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I love Katerina, though she lost her head long ago, poor thing; but Fritz made me put her off my knee,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For he said, "When you're hushabying that silly old doll I know you're not attending to me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now look here, Grethel, I think I have made up my mind that we won't go far;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For we can have a house, and I can be master of it just as well where we are.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the stairs would be a good place for a house for us if there's room.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's very dirty, but you're the housewife now, and you must sweep it out well with the broom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall expect you to keep my house very comfortable, and have my meals ready when there's anything to eat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when Nickel and I come back from playing outside, you may peep out and pretend you're watching for us coming up the street.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You've kept your apple, I see&mdash;I've eaten mine&mdash;well, it will be something to make a start,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
<span class="i0">And I'll put by some of my cake, if you'll keep some of yours, and remember Nickel must have part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I call it your cake and your apple, but of course now you're my housewife everything belongs to me;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I shall give you the management of it, and you must make it go as far as you can amongst three.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if you make nice feasts every day for me and Nickel, and never keep us waiting for our food,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And always do everything I want, and attend to everything I say, I'm sure I shall almost always be good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if I am naughty now and then, it'll most likely be your fault; and, if it isn't, you mustn't mind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For even if I seem to be cross, you ought to know that I mean to be kind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I'm sure you'll like combing Nickel's hair for my sake; it'll be something for you to do, and it bothers me so!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it must be done regularly, for if it's not, his curls tangle into lugs as they grow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think that's all, dear Grethel, for I love you so much that I'm sure to be easy to please.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Only remember&mdash;it's a trifle&mdash;but when I want you, never keep that headless doll on your knees.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'd much rather not have her in my house&mdash;there, don't cry! if you will have her, I suppose it must be;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
<span class="i0">Though I can't think what you want with Katerina when you've got Nickel and me."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I said, "Thank you, dear Fritz, for letting me bring her, for I've had her so long I shouldn't like to part with her now;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I'll try and do everything you want as well as I can, now you've told me how."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But next morning I heard Fritz's garret-window open, and he put out his head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shouted, "Grethel! Grethel! I want you. Be quick! Haven't you got out of bed?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I ran to the window and said, "What is it, dear Fritz?" and he said, "I want to tell you that I've changed my mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hans-Wandermann is here, and he says there are real sapphires on the beach; so I'm off to see what I can find."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh, Fritz!" I said, "can't I come too?" but he said, "You'd better not, you'll only be in the way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You can stop quietly at home with Katerina, and you may have Nickel too, if he'll stay."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Nickel wouldn't. I give him far more of my cake than Fritz does, but he likes Fritz better than me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So dear Katerina and I had breakfast together on the leads under the old myrtle tree.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There once was a Willow, and he was very old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all his leaves fell off from him, and left him in the cold;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There grew upon his hoary head a crop of Mistletoe.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">All wrinkled and furrowed was this old Willow's skin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His taper fingers trembled, and his arms were very thin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two round eyes and hollow, that stared but did not see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sprawling feet that never walked, had this most ancient tree.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A Dame who dwelt near was the only one who knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That every year upon his head the Christmas berries grew;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Oh, Granny dear, tell us," the children cried, "where we<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May find the shining Mistletoe that grows upon the tree?"<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At length the Dame told them, but cautioned them to mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To greet the Willow civilly, <i>and leave a bit behind</i>.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Who cares," said the children, "for this old Willow-man?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We'll take the Mistletoe, and he may catch us if he can."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With rage the ancient Willow shakes in every limb,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they have taken all, and <i>have not left a bit for him</i>!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then bright gleamed the holly, the Christmas berries shone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But in the wintry wind without the Willow-man did moan:<br /></span>

<div><span class="top1">OUR GARDEN.</span></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<span class="i4">The winter is gone; and at first Jack and I were sad,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Because of the snow-man's melting, but now we are glad;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">For the spring has come, and it's warm, and we're allowed to garden in the afternoon;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And summer is coming, and oh, how lovely our flowers will be in June!<br /></span>
<span class="i4">We are so fond of flowers, it makes us quite happy to think<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
<span class="i4">Of our beds&mdash;all colours&mdash;blue, white, yellow, purple, and pink,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Scarlet, lilac, and crimson! And we're fond of sweet scents as well,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And mean to have pinks, roses, sweet peas, mignonette, clove carnations, musk, and everything good to smell;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Lavender, rosemary, and we should like a lemon-scented verbena, and a big myrtle tree!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then if we could get an old "preserved-ginger" pot, and some bay-salt, we could make <i>pot-pourri</i>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jack and I have a garden, though it's not so large as the big one, you know;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But whatever can be got to grow in a garden we mean to grow.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We've got Bachelor's Buttons, and London Pride, and Old Man, and everything that's nice:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And last year Jack sowed green peas for our dolls' dinners, but they were eaten up by the mice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he would plant potatoes in furrows, which made the garden in a mess,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So this year we mean to have no kitchen-garden but mustard and cress.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One of us plants, and the other waters, but Jack likes the watering-pot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then when my turn comes to water he says it's too hot!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
<span class="i0">We sometimes quarrel about the garden, and once Jack hit me with the spade;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we settled to divide it in two by a path up the middle, and that's made.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We want some yellow sand now to make the walk pretty, but there's none about here,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we mean to get some in the old carpet-bag, if we go to the seaside this year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On Monday we went to the wood and got primrose plants and a sucker of a dog-rose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It looks like a green stick in the middle of the bed at present; but wait till it blows!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The primroses were in full flower, and the rose ought to flower soon;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You've no idea how lovely they are in that wood in June!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The primroses look quite withered now, I am sorry to say,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that is not our fault but Nurse's, and it shows how hard it is to garden when you can't have your own way.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We planted them carefully, and were just going to water them all in a lump,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Nurse fetched us both indoors, and put us to bed for wetting our pinafores at the pump.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's very hard, and I'm sure the gardener's plants wouldn't grow any better than ours,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
<span class="i0">If Nurse fetched him in and sent him to bed just when he was going to water his flowers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We've got Blue Nemophila and Mignonette, and Venus's Looking-glass, and many other seeds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Nemophila comes up spotted, which is how we know it from the weeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least it's sure to come up if the hens haven't scratched it up first.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But when it is up the cats roll on it, and that is the worst!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I sowed a ring of sweet peas, and the last time I looked they were coming nicely on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just sprouting white, and I put them safely back; but when Jack looked he found they were gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jack made a great many cuttings, but he has had rather bad luck,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've looked at them every day myself, and not one of them has struck.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gardener gave me a fine moss-rose, but Jack took it to his side,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I kept moving it back, but he took it again, and at last it died.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now we've settled to dig up the path, and have the bed as it was before,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So everything will belong to us both, and we shan't ever quarrel any more.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
<span class="i0">It is such a long time, too, to wait for the sand, and perhaps sea-sand does best on the shore.<br />
</span>
<span class="i0">We're going to take everything up, for it can't hurt the plants to stand on the grass for a minute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And you really can't possibly rake a bed smooth with so many things in it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We shall dig it all over, and get leaf-mould from the wood, and hoe up the weeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when it's tidy we shall plant, and put labels, and strike cuttings, and sow seeds.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We are so fond of flowers, Jack and I often dream at night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of getting up and finding our garden ablaze with all colours, blue, red, yellow, and white.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Midsummer's coming, and big brother Tom will sit under the tree<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With his book, and Mary will beg sweet nosegays of Jack and me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The worst is, we often start for the seaside about Midsummer Day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And no one takes care of our gardens whilst we are away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if we sow lots of seeds, and take plenty of cuttings before we leave home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When we come back, our flowers will be all in full bloom,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
<span class="i0">Bright, bright sunshine above, and sweet, sweet flowers below.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Come, oh Midsummer, quickly come! and go quickly, Midsummer, go!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">P.S. It is so tiresome! Jack wants to build a green-house now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has found some bits of broken glass, and an old window-frame, and he says he knows how.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I tell him there's not glass enough, but he says there's lots,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he's taken all the plants that belong to the bed and put them in pots.<br /></span>

<h2><a name="THE_DOLLS_WASH" id="THE_DOLLS_WASH"></a>THE DOLLS' WASH.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sally is the laundress, and every Saturday<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She sends our clean clothes up from the wash, and Nurse puts them away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sometimes Sally is very kind, but sometimes she's as cross as a Turk;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When she's good-humoured we like to go and watch her at work.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She has tubs and a copper in the wash-house, and a great big fire and plenty of soap;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And outside is the drying-ground with tall posts, and pegs bought from the gipsies, and long lines of rope.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The laundry is indoors with another big fire, and long tables, and a lot of irons, and a crimping-machine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And horses (not live ones with tails, but clothes-horses) and the same starch that is used by the Queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sally wears pattens in the wash-house, and turns up her sleeves, and splashes, and rubs,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
<span class="i0">And makes beautiful white lather which foams over the tops of the tubs,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like waves at the seaside dashing against the rocks, only not so strong.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I were Sally I should sit and blow soap-bubbles all the day long.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sally is angry sometimes because of the way we dirty our frocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Making mud pies, and rolling down the lawn, and climbing trees, and scrambling over the rocks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She says we do it on purpose, and never try to take care;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But if things have got to go to the wash, what can it matter how dirty they are?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last week Mary and I got a lot of kingcups from the bog, and I carried them home in my skirt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was the end of the week, and our frocks were done, so we didn't mind about the dirt.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Sally was as cross as two sticks, and won't wash our dolls' clothes any more&mdash;so she said,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But never mind, for we'll ask Mamma if we may have a real Dolls' Wash of our own instead.<br /></span>
</div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Mamma says we may on one condition, to which we agree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We're to <i>really</i> wash the dolls' clothes, and make them just what clean clothes should be.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
<span class="i0">She says we must wash them thoroughly, which of course we intend to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We mean to rub, wring, dry, mangle, starch, iron, and air them too.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A regular wash must be splendid fun, and everybody knows<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That any one in the world can wash out a few dirty clothes.<br /></span>
</div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Well, we've had the Dolls' Wash, but it's only pretty good fun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We're glad we've had it, you know, but we're gladder still that it's done.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As we wanted to have as big a wash as we could, we collected everything we could muster,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From the dolls' bed dimity hangings to Victoria's dress, which I'd used as a duster.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was going to the wash, and Mary and I were house-maids&mdash;fancy house-maids, I mean&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I took it to dust the bookshelf, for I knew it would come back clean.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well, we washed in the wash-hand-basin, which holds a good deal, as the things are small;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We made a glorious lather, and splashed half over the floor; but the clothes weren't white after all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However, we hung them out in our drying-ground in the garden, which we made with dahlia-sticks and long strings,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
<span class="i0">And then Dash went and knocked over one of the posts, and down in the dirt went our things!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we washed them again and hung them on the towel-horse, and most of them came all right,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Victoria's muslin dress&mdash;though I rinsed it again and again&mdash;will never dry white!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the grease-spots on Mary's doll's dress don't seem to come out, and we can't think how they got there;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unless it was when we made that Macassar-oil, because she has real hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I knew mine was going to the wash, but I'm sorry I used it as a duster before it went;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We think dirty clothes perhaps shouldn't be <i>too</i> dirty before they are sent.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We had sad work in trying to make the starch&mdash;I wonder what the Queen does with hers?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I stirred mine up with a candle, like Sally, but it only made it worse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we had to ask Mamma's leave to have ours made by Nurse.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nurse makes beautiful starch&mdash;like water-arrowroot when you're ill&mdash;in a minute or two.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's a very odd thing that what looks so easy should be so difficult to do!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
<span class="i0">Then Mary put the iron down to heat, but as soon as she'd turned her back,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A jet of gas came sputtering out of the coals and smoked it black.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We dared not ask Sally for another, for we knew she'd refuse it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we had to clean this one with sand and brown-paper before we could use it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was very hard work, but I rubbed till I made it shine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet as soon as it got on a damped "fine thing" it left a brown line.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I rubbed it for a long, long time before it would iron without a mark,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it did at last, and we finished our Dolls' Wash just before dark.<br /></span>
</div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Sally's very kind, for she praised our wash, and she has taken away<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Victoria's dress to do it again; and I really must say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was right when she said, "You see, young ladies, a week's wash isn't all play."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our backs ache, our faces are red, our hands are all wrinkled, and we've rubbed our fingers quite sore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We feel very sorry for Sally every week, and we don't mean to dirty our dresses so much any more.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Father is building a new house, but I've had one given to me for my own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brick red, with a white window, and black where it ought to be glass, and the chimney yellow, like stone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brother Bill made me the shelves with his tool-box, and the table I had before, and the pestle-and-mortar;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mother gave me the jam-pot when it was empty; it's rather big, but it's the only pot we have that will really hold water.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
<span class="i0">We&mdash;that is I and Jemima, my doll. (For it's a Doll's House, you know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though some of the things are real, like the nutmeg-grater, but not the wooden plates that stand in a row.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>They</i> came out of a box of toy tea-things, and I can't think what became of the others;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But one never can tell what becomes of anything when one has brothers.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jemima is much smaller than I am, and, being made of wood, she is thin;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She takes up too much room inside, but she can lie outside on the roof without breaking it in.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish I had a drawing-room to put her in when I want to really cook;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I have to have the kitchen-table outside as it is, and the pestle-and-mortar is rather too heavy for it, and everybody can look.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's no front door to the house, because there's no front to have a door in, and beside,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there were, I couldn't play with anything, for I shouldn't know how to get inside.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never heard of a house with only one room, except the cobbler's, and his was a stall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don't quite know what that is; but it isn't a house, and it served him for parlour and kitchen and all.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
<span class="i0">Father says that whilst he is about it, he thinks he shall add on a wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brother Bill says he'll nail my Doll's House on the top of an old tea-chest, which will come to the same thing.<br /></span>
</div>
<hr style='width: 45%;' />
<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Father's house is not finished, though the wing is; for now the builder says it will be all wrong if there isn't another to match;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And my house isn't done either, though it's nailed on, for Bill took off the roof to make a new one of thatch.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The paint is very much scratched, but he says that's nothing, for it must have had a new coat;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he means to paint it for me, inside and out, when he paints his own boat.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's a sad hole in the floor, but Bill says the wood is as rotten as rotten can be:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was why he made such a mess of the side with trying to put real glass in the window, through which one can see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bill says he believes that the shortest plan would be to make a new Doll's House with proper rooms, in the regular way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was what the builder said to Father when he wanted to build in the old front; and to-day<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
<span class="i0">I heard him tell him the old materials were no good to use and weren't worth the expense of carting away.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don't know when I shall be able to play at dolls again, for all the things are put away in a box;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except Jemima and the pestle-and-mortar, and they're in the bottom drawer with my Sunday frocks.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I almost wish I had kept the house as it was before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We managed very well with a painted window and without a front door.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don't know what Father means to do with his house, but if ever mine is finished, I'll never have it altered any more.<br /></span>

<h2><a name="AN_ONLY_CHILDS_TEA-PARTY" id="AN_ONLY_CHILDS_TEA-PARTY"></a>AN ONLY CHILD'S TEA-PARTY.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When I go to tea with the little Smiths, there are eight of them there, but there's only one of me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which makes it not so easy to have a fancy tea-party as if there were two or three.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had a tea-party on my birthday, but Joe Smith says it can't have been a regular one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Because as to a tea-party with only one teacup and no teapot, sugar-basin, cream-jug, or slop-basin, he never heard of such a thing under the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But it was a very big teacup, and quite full of milk and water, and, you see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There wasn't anybody there who could really drink milk and water except Towser and me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dolls can only pretend, and then it washes the paint off their lips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And what Charles the canary drinks isn't worth speaking of, for he takes such very small sips.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Joe says a kitchen-chair isn't a table; but it has got four legs and a top, so it would be if the back wasn't there;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
<span class="i0">And that does for Charles to perch on, and I have to put the Prince of Wales to lean against it, because his legs have no joints to sit on a chair.<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="center"><img src="images/image_35.png" alt="AN ONLY CHILD'S TEA-PARTY." width="566" height="481" /></div>
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That's the small doll. I call him the Prince of Wales because he's the eldest son, you see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For I've taken him for my brother, and he was Mother's doll before I was born, so of course he is older than me.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[57]</span>
<span class="i0">Towser is my real live brother, but I don't think he's as old as the Prince of Wales;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's a perfect darling, though he whisks everything over he comes near, and I tell him I don't know what we should do if we all had tails.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His hair curls like mine in front, and grows short like a lion behind, but no one need be frightened, for he's as good as good;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And as to roaring like a real menagerie lion, or eating people up, I don't believe he would if he could.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He has his tea out of the saucer after I've had mine out of the cup;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see I am sure to leave some for him, but if I let him begin first he would drink it all up.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The big doll Godmamma gave me this birthday, and the chair she gave me the year before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I haven't many toys, but I take great care of them, and every birthday I shall have more and more.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You've no idea what a beautiful doll she is, and when I pinch her in the middle, she can squeak;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It quite frightened Towser, for he didn't know that any of us but he and I and Charles were able to speak.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've taken her for my only sister, for of course I may take anybody I choose;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've called her Cinderella, because I'm so fond of the story, and because she's got real shoes.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
<span class="i0">I don't feel so <i>only</i> now there are so many of us; for, counting Cinderella there are five,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She, and I, and Towser, and Charles, and the Prince of Wales&mdash;and three of us are really alive;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And four of us can speak, and I'm sure the Prince of Wales is wonderful for his size;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his things (at least he's only got one thing) take off and on, and, though he's nothing but wood, he's got real glass eyes.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And perhaps in three birthdays more there may be as many of us as the Smiths, for five and three make eight;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shall be seven years old then (as old as Joe), but I don't like to think too much of it, it's so long to wait.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And after all I don't know that I want any more of us: I think I'd rather my sister had a chair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like mine; and the next year I should like a collar for Towser if it wouldn't rub off his hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it would be very nice if the Prince of Wales could be dressed like a Field-marshal, for he's got nothing on his legs;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Cinderella's beautifully dressed, and Towser looks quite as if he'd got a fur coat on when he begs.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Joe says it's perfectly absurd, and that I can't take a Pomeranian in earnest for my brother;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
<span class="i0">But I don't think he really and truly knows how much Towser and I love each other.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I didn't like his saying, "Well, there's one thing about your lot,&mdash;you can always have your own way."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then he says, "You can't possibly have fun with four people when you have to pretend what they say."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But, whatever he says, I don't believe I shall ever enjoy a tea-party more than the one that we had on that day.<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Can any one look so wise, and have so little in his head?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How long will it be, Papa Poodle, before you have learned to read?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You were called Papa Poodle because you took care of me when I was a baby:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now I can read words of three syllables, and you sit with a book before you like a regular gaby.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You've not read a word since I put you in that corner ten minutes ago;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bill and I've fought the battle of Waterloo since dinner, and you've not learned BA BE BI BO.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here am I doing the whole British Army by myself, for Bill is obliged to be the French;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
<span class="i0">And I've come away to hear you say your lesson, and left Bill waiting for me in the trench.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And there you sit, with a curly white wig, like the Lord Chief Justice, and as grave a face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking the very picture of goodness and wisdom, when you're really in the deepest disgrace.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those woolly locks of yours grow thicker and thicker, Papa Poodle.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Does the wool tangle inside as well as outside your head? and is it that which makes you such a noodle?<br /></span>

<span class="i0">You seem so clever at some things, and so stupid at others, and I keep wondering why;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I'm afraid the truth is, Papa Poodle, that you're uncommonly sly.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You did no spelling-lessons last week, for you were out from morning till night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Except when you slunk in, like a dirty door-mat on legs, and with one ear bleeding from a fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looking as if you'd no notion what o'clock it was, and had come home to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But <i>your watch keeps very good meal-time</i>, Papa Poodle, for you're always at breakfast, and dinner, and tea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, it's no good your shaking hands and licking me with your tongue,&mdash;I know you can do that;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But sitting up, and giving paws, and kissing, won't teach you to spell C A T, Cat.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
<span class="i0">I wonder, if I let you off lessons, whether I could teach you to pull the string with your teeth, and fire our new gun?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I could, you might be the Artillery all to yourself, and it would be capital fun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You wag your tail at that, do you? You would like it a great deal better?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I can't bear you to be such a dunce, when you look so wise; and yet I don't believe you'll ever learn a letter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aunt Jemima is going to make me a new cocked hat out of the next old newspaper, for I want to have a review;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the newspaper after that, Papa Poodle, must be kept to make a fool's cap for you.<br /></span>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The following note was given in <i>Aunt Judy's Magazine</i>, June
1880, when "Grandmother's Spring" first appeared:&mdash;"It may
interest old readers of <i>Aunt Judy's Magazine</i> to know that
'Leave some for the Na&iuml;ads and the Dryads' was a favourite
phrase with Mr. Alfred Gatty, and is not merely the charge of
an imaginary mother to her 'blue-eyed banditti.' Whether my
mother invented the expression for our benefit, or whether she
only quoted it, I do not know. I only remember its use as a
check on the indiscriminate 'collecting' and 'grubbing' of a
large family; a mystic warning not without force to fetter the
same fingers in later life, with all the power of a pious tradition."&mdash;J.H.E.</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">I always <i>was</i> a remarkable child; so old for my age, and such a sensitive nature!&mdash;Mamma often says so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I'm the sweetest, little dear in my blue ribbons, and quite a picture in my Pompadour hat!&mdash;Mrs. Brown told her so on Sunday, and that's how I know.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
<span class="i0">And I'm a sacred responsibility to my parents&mdash;(it was what the clergyman's wife at the seaside said),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a solemn charge, and a fair white page, and a tender bud, and a spotless nature of wax to be moulded;&mdash;but the rest of it has gone out of my head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was a lot more, and she left two books as well, and I think she called me a Privilege, and Mamma said "Yes," and began to cry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nurse came in with luncheon on a tray, and put away the books, and said she was as weak as a kitten, and worried to fiddlestrings, as any one with common sense could see with half an eye.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I was hopping round the room, but I stopped and said, "My kitten's not weak, and I don't believe anybody could see with only half an eye. Could they, Mamma?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nurse said, "Go and play, my dear, and let your Mamma rest;" but Mamma said, "No, my love, stay where you are.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dear Nurse, lift me up, and put a pillow to my back, I know you mean to be kind;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she does ask such remarkable questions, and while I've strength to speak, don't let me check the inquiring mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I should fail to be all a mother ought&mdash;oh, how
my head throbs when the dear child jumps!" and then Nurse said, "Ugh!<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
<span class="i0">When you're worried into your grave, she'll have no mother at all, and 'll have to tumble up as other folks do.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's the poor master at his wits' end&mdash;a child's not all a grown person has to think of&mdash;and Miss Jane would do well enough if she'd less of her own way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there's more children spoilt with care than the want of it, and more mothers murdered than there's folks hanged for, and that's what I say.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Children learns what you teach 'em, and Miss Jane's old enough to have learned to wait upon you:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if her mother thought less of her and she thought more of her mother, it would be better for her too."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Nurse is a nasty cross old thing&mdash;I hate her; and I hate the doctor, for he wanted me to be left behind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When Mamma went to the sea for her health; but I begged and begged till she promised I should go, for Mamma is always kind.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And she bought me a new wooden spade and a basket, and a red and green ship with three masts, and a one-and-sixpenny telescope to look at the sea;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span>
<span class="i0">But when I got on to the sands, I thought I'd rather be on the esplanade, for there was a little girl there who was looking at me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dressed in a navy-blue suit and a sailor hat, with fair hair tied with ribbons; so I told Mamma,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she got me a suit, ready-made (but she said it was dreadfully dear), and a hat to match, in the Pebble Brooch Repository and Universal Bazaar.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It faded in the sun, and came all to pieces in the wash; but I was tired of it before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the esplanade is very dull, and the little girl with fair hair had got sand-boots and a shrimping-net and was playing on the shore.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when my sand-boots came home, and I'd got a better net than hers, she went donkey-riding, and I knew it was to tease me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Nurse was so cross, and said if they sent a man in a herring-boat to the moon for what I wanted that nothing would please me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I said the seaside was a very disagreeable place, and I wished I hadn't come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I told Mamma so, and begged her to try and get well soon, to take us all home.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now we've got home, it's very hot, and I'm afraid of the wasps; and I'm sure it was cooler at the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
<span class="i0">And the Smiths won't be back for a fortnight, so I can't even have Matilda to tea.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don't care much for my new doll&mdash;I think I'm too old for dolls now; I like books better, though I didn't like the last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I've read all I have: I always skip the dull parts, and when you skip a good deal you get through them so fast.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I like toys if they're the best kind, with works; though when I've had one good game with them, I don't much care to play with them again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I feel as if I wanted something new to amuse me, and Mamma says it's because I've got such an active brain.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Nurse says I don't know what I want, and I know I don't, and that's just what it is.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems so sad a young creature like me should feel unhappy, and not know what's amiss;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But Nurse never thinks of my feelings, any more than the cruel nurse in the story about the little girl who was so good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if I die early as she did, perhaps then people will be sorry I've been misunderstood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I shouldn't like to die early, but I should like people to be sorry for me, and to praise me when I was dead:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I could only come to life again when they had
missed me very much, and I'd heard what they said&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
<span class="i0">Of course that's impossible, I know, but I wish I knew what to do instead!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It seems such a pity that a sweet little dear like me should ever be sad.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Mamma says she buys everything I want, and has taught me everything I will learn, and reads every book, and takes every hint she can pick up, and keeps me with her all day, and worries about me all night, till she's nearly mad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if any kind person can think of any better way to make me happy we shall both of us be glad.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Me to humbly commend to your tender mercies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The hero of these simple verses.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By domicile, of the British Nation;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By birth and family, a Crustacean.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A Lobster, who dwelt with several others,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His sisters and brothers,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a secluded but happy home,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the salt sea's foam.<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the outermost point of a rocky bay.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Shells and pebbles, and wrack below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shrimpers shrimping all in a row;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tawny sails and tarry boats,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dark brown nets and old cork floats;<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i5">"It is sweet to be<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And when the mid-day midsummer sun<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is toasting the fields as brown as a bun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sands are baking, it's very nice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To feel as cool as a strawberry ice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In one's own particular damp sea-cave,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dipping one's feelers in each green wave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It is good, for a very rapacious maw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When storm-tossed morsels come to the claw;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And 'the better to see with' down below,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wash one's eyes in the ebb and flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the tides that come and the tides that go."<br /></span>

<span class="i1">No matter if the tide were high or low,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We wish you could live in a higher sphere,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we think you might live happily here."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I don't live, I only exist," he said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Be pleased to look upon me as dead."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he swam to his cave, and took to his bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sulked so long that the sisters cried,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Perhaps he has really and truly died."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the brothers went to the cave to peep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For they said, "Perhaps he is only asleep."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They found him, far too busy to talk,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With a very large piece of bad salt pork.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Dear Brother, what luck you have had to-day!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can you tell us, pray,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is there any more pork afloat in the bay?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not a word would my hero say,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"This is not life, it's only existence."<br /></span>

<i>Homarus vulgaris</i>, the common lobster, is spotted, and, on the

blue and violet.</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">A little Brook, that babbled under grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Once saw a Poet pass&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A Poet with long hair and saddened eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who went his weary way with woeful sighs.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And on another time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This Brook did hear that Poet read his rueful rhyme.<br /></span>

<span class="i4">This Poet said&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Oh! little Brook that babblest under grass!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What time your babbling mocks my mortal moods,</span>
<span class="i3">Fair Na&iuml;ad of the stream!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With wreathed forget-me-nots about your head,<br /></span>
<span class="i5">And sing and play,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">His homeward way he took;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And nevermore that Poet saw that Brook.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Brook passed several days in anxious expectation<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Into a lovely nymph bedecked with flowers;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">That should all mortal men mysteriously beguile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For life as running water lost its charm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before the exciting hope of doing so much harm.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And yet the hope seemed vain;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Despite the Poet's strain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though the days came and went, and went and came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The seasons changed, the Brook remained the same.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The Brook was almost tired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of vainly hoping to become a Na&iuml;ad;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When on a certain Summer's day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dame Nature came that way,<br /></span>

<span class="i5">With great and small;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who, at the water-side<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dipping her clever fingers in the tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Out of the mud drew creeping things,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, smiling on them, gave them radiant wings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now when the poor Brook murmured, "Mother dear!"<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Dame Nature bent to hear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sad stream poured all its woes into her sympathetic ear,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[114]</span>
<span class="i0">Crying,&mdash;"Oh, bounteous Mother!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then Mother Nature, who is wondrous wise,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Run, as of yore, on its appointed race,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Outliving human lives, outlasting human charms.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But good advice, however kind,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The sun burst forth with most amazing power.<br /></span>
<span class="i5">Dame Nature bade him blaze, and he obeyed;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He drove the fainting flocks into the shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He ripened all the flowers into seed,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He dried the river, and he parched the mead;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then on the Brook he turned his burning eye,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which rose and left its narrow channel dry;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, climbing up by sunbeams to the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Became a snow-white cloud, which softly floated by.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i3">It was a glorious Autumn day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the world with red and gold was gay;<br /></span>
<span class="i3">When, as this cloud athwart the heavens did pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lying below, it saw a Poet on the grass,<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
<span class="i3">The very Poet who had such a stir made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To prove the Brook was a fresh-water mermaid.<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And now,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding his book above his corrugated brow&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">He read aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thus apostrophized the passing cloud:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">"Oh, snowy-breasted Fair!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mysterious messenger of upper air!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Can you be of those female forms so dread,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who bear the souls of the heroic dead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where undying laurels crown the warrior's head?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or, as you smile and hover,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are you not rather some fond goddess of the skies who waits a mortal lover?<br /></span>
<span class="i4">And who, ah! who is he?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;And what, oh, what!&mdash;your message to poor me?"&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So far the Poet. Then he stopped:<br /></span>
<span class="i4">His book had dropped.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But ere the delighted cloud could make reply,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dame Nature hurried by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it put forth a wild beseeching cry&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Give me a human face and form!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dame Nature frowned, and all the heavens grew black with storm.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Falling most softly on the floor most hard<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of an old manor-house court-yard.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Who swept and shovelled up the fallen snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which whimpered,&mdash;"Oh! oh! oh!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, Mother, most severe!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Pity me lying here,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">They built him bravely with might and main,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">There never will be such a snow-man again!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His legs were big, his body was bigger,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They made him a most imposing figure;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His eyes were large and as black as coal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For a cinder was placed in each round hole.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the sight of his teeth would have made yours ache,<br /></span>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Our home used to be in a hut in the dear old Camp, with lots of bands and trumpets and bugles and Dead Marches, and three times a day there was a gun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But now we live in View Villa at the top of the village, and it isn't nearly such fun.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
<span class="i0">We never see any soldiers, except one day we saw a Volunteer, and we ran after him as hard as ever we could go, for we thought he looked rather brave;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But there's only been one funeral since we came, an ugly black thing with no Dead March or Union Jack, and not even a firing party at the grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There is a man in uniform to bring the letters, but he's nothing like our old Orderly, Brown;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I told him, through the hedge, "Your facings are dirty, and you'd have to wear your belt if my father was at home," and oh, how he did frown!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But things can't be expected to go right when Old Father's away, and he's gone to the war;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which is why we play at soldiers and fighting battles more than ever we did before.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I try to keep things together: every morning I have a parade of myself and Dick,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To see that we are clean, and to drill him and do sword-exercise with poor Grandpapa's stick.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Grandpapa's dead, so he doesn't want it now, and Dick's too young for a real tin sword like mine:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He's so young he won't make up his mind whether he'll go into the Artillery or the Line.<br />
</span>
<span class="i0">I want him to be a gunner, for his frock's dark blue, and Captain Powder gave us a wooden gun with an elastic that shoots quite a big ball.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
<span class="i0">It's nonsense Dick's saying he'd like to be a Chaplain, for that's not being a soldier at all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, he always wants to be Drum-Major when we've funerals, to stamp the stick and sing RUM&mdash;TUM&mdash;TUM&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To the Dead March in <i>Saul</i> (that's the name of the tune, and you play it on a drum).<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I asked her what she would do if she were grown up into a woman, and belonged to some one who was wounded in the war,&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She said she'd go out and nurse him: so I said, "But supposing you couldn't get him better, and he died; how would you behave?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she said if she couldn't get a ship to bring him home in, she should stay out there and grow a garden, and make wreaths for his grave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nurse says we oughtn't to have battles, now Father's gone to battle, but that's just the reason why!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I don't believe one bit what she said about its making Mother cry.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only she does like us to put away our toys on Sunday, so we can't have the soldiers or the gun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yesterday Dick said, "I was thinking in church, and I've thought of a game about soldiers, and it's a perfectly Sunday one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It's a Church Parade: you'll have to be a lot of officers and men, Mary'll do for a few wives and families, and I'll be Chaplain to the Forces and pray for everyone at the war."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
<span class="i0">So he put his nightgown over his knickerbocker suit, and knelt on the Ashantee stool, and Mary and I knelt on the floor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I think it was rather nice of Dick, for he said what put it into his head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was thinking they mightn't have much time for their prayers on active service, and we ought to say them instead.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I should have liked to parade the lead soldiers, but I didn't, for Mother says, "What's the good of being a soldier's son if you can't do as you're bid?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we thought there'd be no harm in letting the box be there if we kept on the lid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dick couldn't pray out of the Prayer-book, because he's backward with being delicate, and he can't read;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he had to make a prayer out of his own head, and I think he did it very well indeed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He began, "GOD save the Queen, and the Army and the Navy, and the Irregular Forces and the Volunteers!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Especially Old Father (he went out with the first draft, and he's a Captain in the Royal Engineers").<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I said, "I don't think 'GOD save the Queen' is a
proper prayer, I think it's only a sort of three cheers."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
<span class="i0">So he said, "GOD bless the Generals, and the Colonels, and the Majors, and the Captains, and the Lieutenants, and the Sub-lieutenants, and the Quartermasters, and the non-commissioned officers, and the men;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bands, and the colours, and the guns, and the horses and the wagons, and the gun-carriage they use for the funerals; and please I should like them all to come home safe again.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Don't, Mary! I haven't finished; it isn't time for you to say Amen.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I haven't prayed for the Chaplains, or the Doctors who help the poor men left groaning on the ground when the victories are won;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I want to pray particularly for the very poor ones who die of fever and miss all the fighting and fun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">GOD bless the good soldiers, like Old Father, and Captain Powder, and the men with good-conduct medals; and please let the naughty ones all be forgiven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if the black men kill our men, send down white angels to take their poor dear souls to Heaven!<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Now</i> you may both say Amen, and I shall give out hymn four hundred and thirty-seven."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
<span class="i0">There are eight verses and eight Alleluias, and we can't sing very well, but we did our best,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only Mary would cry in the verse about "Soon, soon to faithful warriors comes their rest!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But we're both very glad Dick has found out a Sunday game about fighting, for we never had one before;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And now we can play at soldiers every day till Old Father comes home from the war.<br /></span>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap"><b>Brother Bill.</b></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To have a good birthday for a grown-up person is very difficult indeed;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We don't give it up, for Mother says the harder things are, the harder you must try till you succeed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still, <i>our</i> birthdays are different; we want so many things, and choosing your own pudding, and even half-holidays are treats;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But what can you do for people who always order the dinner, and never have lessons, and don't even like sweets?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I know Mother does not. Baby put a big red comfit in her mouth, and I saw her take it out again on the sly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I don't believe she even enjoys going a-gypseying, for she gets neuralgia if she stands about where it isn't dry.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span>
<span class="i0">And how can you boil the kettle if you're not near the brook? But it's the last time she shall go there,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I told her so; I said, "What's the good of having five sons, except to mount guard over you, you Queen of all Mothers that ever were?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But she's not easy to manage, and she shams sometimes, and shamming is a thing I can't bear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She shammed about the red comfit, when she didn't think Baby could see her;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And (because they're the only things we can think of for birthday presents for her) she shams wearing out a needle-book and a pin-cushion every year.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The only things we can think of for Father are paper-cutters; but there's no sham about <i>his</i> wearing <i>them</i> out;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He would always lose them, long before his next birthday, if Mother did not keep finding them lying about.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Last year's paper-cutter was as big as a sword (not as big as Father's sword, but as big as a wooden one, like ours),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he left it behind in a railway-carriage, when he'd had it just thirty-six hours;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So we knew he was ready for another. It was Mother's birthday that bothered us so;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And if it hadn't been for Dolly's Major (he's her Godfather, and she calls him "my Major"), what we should have done I really don't know!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, "What's the matter?" And Dolly said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Mother's birthday's the matter." And I said, "We can't think what to devise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To give her a birthday treat that won't give her neuralgia, and will take her by surprise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look here, Major! How can you give people treats who can order what they wish for far better than you?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wonder what they do for the Queen!&mdash;her birthday must be the hardest of all." But he said, "Not a bit of it! They have a review:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cocked hats and all the rest of it; and a salute, and a <i>feu de joie</i>, and a March-Past.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's the way we keep the Queen's Birthday; and every year the same as the last."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I settled at once to have a Mother's Birthday Review; and that she should be Queen, and I should be the General in command.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I thought she couldn't come to any harm by sitting in a fur cloak and a birthday wreath at the window, and bowing and waving her hand.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We did not tell her what was coming, we only asked for leave to have all the seven donkeys for an hour and a half;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
<span class="i0">(We always hire them from the same old man)&mdash;two for the girls, and five for me and my brothers&mdash;I told him, "for me and my Staff."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We could have managed with five, if the girls would only have been Maids of Honour, and stayed indoors with the Queen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maggie would if I'd asked her; but Dolly will go her own way, and that's into the thick of everything, to see whatever there is to be seen.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She's only four years old, but she's ridiculously like the picture of an ancient ancestress of ours<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who defended an old castle in Cornwall, against the French, for hours and hours.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her husband was away, so she was in command, and all her household obeyed her;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She made them strip the lead off the roofs, and they did, and she boiled it down and gave it very hot indeed to the French invader.
<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a><br /></span>

<span class="i0">But she's very good; she made all our cocked hats, and at the review she and Dolly and  Spike were the loyal crowd.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Dick and Tom and Harry were the troops, and I was the General, and Mother looked quite like a Queen at the window, and bowed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The donkeys made very good chargers on the whole, and especially mine;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Jem's was the only one that gave trouble, and neither fair means nor foul would keep him in line.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And Jem caught him a whack with the flat of his sword (a thing you never see done on the Staff), and it rather spoilt the salute;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the spirit of the troops was excellent, and we'd a <i>feu de joie</i> with penny pistols (Jem's donkey was the only one that shied), and Dolly's Major says that, all things considered, he never saw a better March-Past;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I behave beautifully at meals, and at church, and I can put on my own boots, and can say a good deal of the Catechism, and ride a donkey, and play at any boys' game.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've ridden a donkey that kicks (at least I rode him as long as I was on), and a donkey that rolls, and an old donkey that goes lame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I mean to ride like a lady now, but that's because I ought, not because I easily can;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For what with your legs and your pommels (I mean the saddle's pommels), it would be much easier always to ride like a man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Boys <i>look</i> braver, but I think it's really more dangerous to ride sideways, because of the saddle slipping round.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(I didn't cry; I played at slipping round the world, and getting to New Zealand with my head upside down on the ground.)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The reason the saddle is slippery is not because it's smooth, for it's rather rough; and there's a hard ridge behind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the horse's hair coming through the donkey's back (I mean through his saddle) scratches you<br /></span>

<span class="i0">dreadfully; but I tuck my things under me, and pretend I don't mind.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They work out again though, particularly when they are starched, and I think frocks get shorter every time they go to the wash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I don't complain; if it's very uncomfortable, I make an ugly face to myself, and say, "Bosh!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We've all of us had a good deal of practice, so we ought to know how to ride;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We've ridden a great deal since we came to live on the Heath, and we rode a good deal when Father was stationed at the sea-side.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Major taught me to ride sideways, and at first he would hold me on;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I don't like being touched; and I don't call it riding like a lady if you're held on by an officer, and I'd rather tumble off if I can't stick on by myself; so I sent him away, and the nasty saddle slipped round directly he was gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I only crushed my sun-bonnet, and the donkey stood quite still. (We always call that one "the old stager.")<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wasn't frightened, except just the tiniest bit; but he says he was dreadfully frightened. So I said, "Then you ought to be ashamed of yourself, considering all your medals, and that you're a Major."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
<span class="i0">He likes me very much, and I like him, and when my fifth birthday comes, he says I'm to choose a donkey, and he'll buy it for me, but the saddle and bridle shall be quite new;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So I've made up my mind to choose the one Brother Bill had for his charger at Mother's Birthday Review;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Maggie is so glad, she says her life is quite miserable with thinking how miserable other lives are, if only we knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Maggie loves every creature that lives; she won't confess to black beetles, but she can't stamp on them (I've stamped out lots in my winter boots), and she doesn't even think a donkey ugly when he brays;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she says she shall buy a brush, out of her pocket-money, and brush my donkey every day till he looks like a horse, and that it shan't be her fault if there isn't one poor old brute beast who lives happily to the end of his days.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The dew falls over the Heath, Brother Donkeys, and the darkness falls, but still through the gathering night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All around us spreads the Heath Bed-straw<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> in glimmering sheets of white.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
<span class="i0">Dragged and trampled, and plucked and wasted, it patiently spreads and survives;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Kicked and thwacked, and prodded and over-laden, we patiently cling to our lives.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hee-haw! for the rest and silence of darkness that follow the labours of light.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hee-haw! for the hours from night to morning, that balance the hours from morning to night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hee-haw! for the sweet night air that gives human beings cold in the head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hee-haw! for the civilization that sends human beings to bed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rest, Brother Donkeys, rest, from the bit, the burden, the blow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dust, the flies, the restless children, the brutal roughs, the greedy donkey-master, the greedier donkey-hirer, the holiday-maker who knows no better, and the holiday-makers who ought to know!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the odorous furze-bush prickles the seeking nose, and the short damp grass refreshes the tongue,&mdash;lend, Brother Donkeys, lend a long and attentive ear!<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Whilst I proudly bray<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Of the one bright day<br /></span>
<span class="i4">In our hard and chequered career.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I've dragged pots, and vegetables, and invalids, and
fish, and I've galloped with four costermongers to the races;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span>
<span class="i0">I've carried babies, and sea-coal, and sea-sand, and sea-weed in panniers, and been sold to the gypsies, and been bought back for the sea-side, and ridden (in a white saddle-cloth with scarlet braid) by the fashionable visitors. (There was always a certain distinction in my paces,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though I say it who shouldn't) I've spent a summer on the Heath, and next winter near Covent Garden, and moved the following year to the foot of a mountain, to take people up to the top to show them the view.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But how little we know what's before us! And how little I guessed I should ever be chief charger at a Queen's Birthday Review!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Did I triumph alone? No, Brother Donkeys, no! You also took your place with the defenders of the nation;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Subordinate positions to my own, but meritoriously filled, though a little more style would have well become so great an occasion.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That malevolent old Moke&mdash;may his next thistle choke him!&mdash;disgraced us all with his jibbing&mdash;the ill-tempered old ass!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young Neddy is shaggy and shy, but not amiss, if he'd held his ears up, and not kept his eyes on the grass.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
<span class="i0">Nothing is more je-june (I may say vulgar) than to seem anxious to eat when the crisis calls for public spirit, enthusiasm, and an elevated tone;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I wish, Brother Donkeys, I wish that all had felt as I felt, the responsibility of a March-Past the Throne!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Respect and self-respect delicately blended; one ear up, and the other lowered to salute, as I passed the window from which we were seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Unless I grievously misunderstood the young General this morning,) by no less a personage than her Most Gracious Majesty <span class="smcap">The Queen</span>.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sleep, Brother Donkeys, sleep! But I fancy you're sleeping already, for you make no reply;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Not a quiver of your ears, not a sign from your motionless drooping noses, dark against the dusky night sky.<br />
</span>
<span class="i0">As black and immovable as the silent fir-trees you solemnly slumber beneath,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilst I wakefully meditate on a glorious past, and painfully ponder the future, as the dews fall over the Heath.<br /></span>

<h2><a name="CONVALESCENCE" id="CONVALESCENCE"></a>CONVALESCENCE.</h2>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Hold my hand, little Sister, and nurse my head, whilst I try to remember the word,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was it?&mdash;that the doctor says is now fairly established both in me and my bird.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">C-O-N-<i>con</i>, <i>with a con</i>, S-T-A-N-<i>stan</i>, <i>with a stan</i>&mdash;No! That's Constantinople, that is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The capital of the country where rhubarb-and-magnesia comes from, and I wish they would keep it in that country, and not send it to this.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">C-O-N-<i>con</i>&mdash;how my head swims! Now I've got it! C-O-N-V-A-L-E-S-C-E-N-C-E.<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Convalescence!</i> And that's what the doctor says is now fairly established both in my blackbird and me.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He says it means that you are better, and that you'll be well by and by.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so the Sea-captain says, and he says we ought to be friends, because we're both convalescents&mdash;at least we're all three convalescents, my blackbird, and the Captain and I.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
<span class="i0">He's a sea-captain, not a land-captain, but, all the same, he was in the war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he fought,&mdash;for I asked him,&mdash;and he's been ill ever since, and that's why he's not afloat, but ashore;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And why somebody else has got his ship; and she behaved so beautifully in the battle, and he loves her quite as much as his wife, and rather better than the rest of his relations, for I asked him; and now he's afraid she will never belong to him any more.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I like him. I've seen him three times out walking with two sticks, when I was driving in the bath-chair, but I never talked to him till to-day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He'd only one stick and a telescope, and he let me look through it at the big ship that was coming round the corner into the bay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was very kind, and let me ask questions. I said, "Are you a sea-captain?" and he said, "Yes." And I said, "How funny it is about land things and sea things!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There are captains and sea-captains, and weeds and sea-weeds, and serpents and sea-serpents. Did you ever meet one, and is it really like the dragons on our very old best blue tea-things?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he never did. So I asked him, "Have you got convalescence? Does your doctor say it is
fairly established? Do your eyes ache if you try to read, and your neck if you draw, and your back if you sit up, and your head if you talk?<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span>
<span class="i0">Don't you get tired of doing nothing, and worse tired still if you do anything; and does everything wobble about when you walk?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Wouldn't you rather go back to bed? I think I would. Don't you wish you were well? Wouldn't you rather be ill than only better? I do hate convalescence, don't you?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then I stopped asking, and he shut up his telescope, and sat down on the shingle, and said, "When you come to my age, little chap, you won't think 'What is it I'd rather have?' but, 'What is it I've got to do?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'What have I got to do or to bear; and how can I do it or bear it best?'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That's the only safe point to make for, my lad. Make for it, and leave the rest!"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I said, "But <i>wouldn't</i> you rather be in battles than in bed, with your head aching as if it would split?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he said, "Of course I would; so would most men. But, my little convalescent, that's not it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What would <i>you</i> think of a man who was ordered into battle, and went grumbling and wishing he were in bed?"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
<span class="i0">"What should I think of the fellow? Why, I should know he was a coward," I said.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"And if he were confined to bed," said the Sea-captain, "and lay grumbling and wishing he were in battle, I should give him no better a name;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the courage that dares, and the courage that bears, are really one and the same."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold my hand, little Sister, and nurse my head, for I'm thinking, and I very much fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You've had no good of being well since I was ill; I've led you such a life; but indeed I am obliged to you, dear!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is it true that Nurse has got something the matter with her legs, and that Mary has gone home because she's worn out with nursing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And won't be fit to work for months? (will <i>she</i> be convalescent, because it was such hard work waiting on <i>me</i>?) and did Cook say, "So much grumbling and complaining is nigh as big a sin as swearing and cursing"?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I wish I hadn't been so cross with poor Mary, and I wish I hadn't given so much trouble about my medicine and my food.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I didn't think about her. I only thought what a bother it was. I wish I hadn't thought so much about being miserable, that I never thought of trying to be good.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
<span class="i0">I believe the Sea-captain is right, and I shall tell him so to-morrow, when he comes here to tea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He's going to look at my blackbird's leg, and if it is really set, he wants me to let it go free.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He says captivity is worse than convalescence, and so I should think it must be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are you tired, little Sister? You feel shaky. Don't beg my pardon; I beg yours. I've not let you go out of my sight for weeks. Get your things on, and have a gallop on Jack.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Ride round this way and let me see you. I won't say a word about wishing I was going too; and if my head gets bad whilst you're away, I will bear it my very best till you come back.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell me one thing before you start. If I learn to be patient, shall I learn to be brave, do you think? The Sea-captain says so.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He says, "Self-command is the making of a man," and he's a finely-made man himself, so he ought to know.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps, if I try hard at Convalescence now, I may become a brave sea-captain hereafter, and take my beautiful ship into battle, and bring her out again with flying colours and fame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If the courage that dares, and the courage that bears, <i>are</i> really one and the same.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">It was on such a night as this,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">Some long unreal years ago,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When all within were wrapp'd in sleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">And all without was wrapp'd in snow,<br /></span>

<span class="i3">Has painted the familiar scene.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By all the shores, on every sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">In luck or loss, by night or day,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">My highest hope has been to see<br /></span>
<span class="i3">That home from which I ran away.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">On such a night at last I came,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">But they were dead I loved of yore.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ah, Mother, then my heart felt all<br /></span>
<span class="i3">The pain it should have felt before!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">I came away, though loth to come,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">I clung, and yet why should I cling?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When all have gone who made it home,<br /></span>
<span class="i3">It is the shadow, not the thing.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A homeless man, once more I seek my fortune on the main:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I marvel with how little hope, and with what bitter pain.<br /></span>

electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"

Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
